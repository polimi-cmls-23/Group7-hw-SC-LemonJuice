# A SuperCollider Grain Synth sample based 
Computer Music: Languages and Systems

Homework 1 - Group 7 - LemonJuice


The project involves the development of a granular synthesizer using Supercollider for sound design.
The granular synth allows you to use a mix of two samples to generate an output made up of grains. 
In addition to the classic controls of a granular synth, both for the samples and the grains, as well as for the output, the pitch can be varied to obtain creative variations and results. 
The project includes an effective graphical interface for controlling the parameters.
